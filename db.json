      "description": "Delicious warm apples reminds you of Granny's house",
      "ingredients": [
        "3 pounds mixed apples",
        "2/3 cup granulated sugar",
        "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
        "6 tablespoons unsalted butter",
        "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting",
        "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
        "1/8 teaspoon salt",
        "1 large egg, beaten"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and salt; cook until thickened, 1 more minute. Let cool.",
        "Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface; ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the apples, mounding them slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay it over the filling; press the edges of the crusts together, then fold the overhang under itself and crimp to seal. Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Chill 1 hour.",
        "Place a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Cool on a rack."
